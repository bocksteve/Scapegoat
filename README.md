# Scapegoat
Self-balancing BST with variable levels of balancing based on an alpha between 0.5-1


Commands to insert/delete go into the tree.txt file.  The first line will be BuildTree x y, where x = the alpha, y = value of root node.
Print will print out the current tree in a readable format, assuming the tree is not too large.  Done simply ends the commands.
